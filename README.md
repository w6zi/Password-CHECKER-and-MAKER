Made and mantained since 2025
You can use this simple code to check if your passwords are secure, I made this because I personally dont really trust those websites. So I made the simple python script that will solve this problem, if you want you can download it to both check your passwords and make new ones, and NO it does not save them somewhere for me or anything

STEPS!
1 download the code from the versions tab
2 double click on the file
3 DONE! Enjoy having secure passwords from now on :)
